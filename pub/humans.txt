    We live in a world in which hostile thoughts and
       ideas are constantly present in the media,
      pressing in on our consciousness. Events are
         often also outside of our control.
  
             Outside of *our* control,
            but not outside of control.
        Others use these concepts and events
	  to create this anxiety on others.
